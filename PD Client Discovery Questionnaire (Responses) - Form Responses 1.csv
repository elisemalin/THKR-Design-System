Like aspects of the site's design (animated elements, parallax(?) imagery / design, data visualizations, etc.); https://www.azhumane.org/foster/ - like aspects of the site like their use of color; how they visualize certain processes like steps to ""Become a Foster Hero""; the way they incorporate FAQs into the mix and how they feature the pets available for fostering. Also like how they approach their donations page (See section under ""Make a Gift"" dropdown)","https://kneadingkittysrescueaz.com/ - so minimal and lacking (any) color, it feels sterile and boring. Very text heavy, yet key info appears absent. Lacks imagery, animation...life. Overall, it doesn't make us feel much of anything, except maybe bored.  https://www.jensneonatalnursery.com - Too childish. Poor layout and design. Content, copy, images, buttons, etc. all feel visually out of proportion. Makes it feel amateur-ish. Site organization is poor - ex. Foster + Adopt sections in global nav have virtually no content when you click through - seems any relevant Foster + Adopt  content is in ""Services"" section?? ","“Playful + Creative + Heartfelt + Hopeful + Trustworthy” NOTE: I have a more detailed breakdown of what I see each of these reflecting that I'll share. Another way of framing it could be: The website should feel like stepping into a bright, loving space where creativity meets compassion — playful like a kitten, heartfelt like a hug, and trustworthy like a close friend.","Playful - lighthearted, joyful, curious and irresistibly endearing; Heartfelt - warmth, empathy, and authenticity; Hopeful - positive, optimistic and uplifting; Creative - imaginative, full of personality, a bit quirky / cheeky - equal parts imagination + knowledge; Trustworthy - transparent, accountable and committed to our mission — even if our tone is playful",I have some content,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1G_O9RuKgR4OsloYQEUd0St4VQJpxBYLT,"Blogger Sans Bold, Medium, Regular, Light; NOTE: Considering a shift in font for everything except the logo. Interested to get your thoughts in some options (will pull together shortlist).",Charlotte and I,Mix of all,Afternoons and evenings ,Nope. We're incredibly excited to partner with you on this!,We're excited to see the version of the site we initially envisioned actually come to life and function the way it's supposed to. :) ,"Additional priorities:  the mobile version of the site - design, functionality, etc. and SEO. Would also like to explore various design options for the way we feature available kittens (adoption + foster) - would like something more than what currently exists on our site (API or something that pulls the crappy image + bio format from our shelter management system). Would also like to see what we can do to amplify our donate page / donation efforts across the site. As we ramp up our social media efforts, would be good to have module / carousel of social feeds or something along those lines.  ...and let's not forget about the PDF I pulled together that outlined all feedback + changes I had for the current vers. of the site."
